# Two Up Coin Game

This casino style coin game is loosely based on the *classic* Australian game "Two Up". This is a java project that will incorporate OOP principles such as cohesion and the minimisation of coupling.

## Rules:

The spinner will flip two coins. And each of the players will also spin 2 coins. Before they players flip their coins, they will make __one of four bets__. The first being whether their first coin will match the players first coin. The second (similar to first) is that the player's second coin will match the spinner's second coin. For both of these bets, if the player bets 100 dollars, they will win or lose 100 dollars __(one-to-one odds)__.

If the player bets that both coins will match the spinners coins, then a 100 bet will 200 dollars. However, a loss will mean the player looses 100 dollars __(2 to 1 for win, 1 to 1 for loss)__.

Finally, the player can make no bet and no action will be taken.
